## Introduction

The global healthcare landscape faces a **rapidly aging population**, skyrocketing **chronic disease** burdens, and fragmented, siloed health data. LifeOS addresses these challenges by:

- **Putting patients at the center** of their healthcare journey.  
- Leveraging **preventive, AI-driven insights** to reduce risks and optimize lifestyle.  
- Enabling **secure, patient-owned data management** so that individuals can control and monetize their health information on their terms.

This repository showcases an **MVP** that demonstrates core LifeOS concepts—**Gradio-based** user interface, AI agent placeholders, and a simplified data privacy “vault.”

## Problem Statement

1. **Aging Population**  
   By 2030, more than 1 in 6 people worldwide will be aged 60 or older (WHO).  

2. **Chronic Disease Burden**  
   Chronic conditions account for over 75% of healthcare costs in the US (CDC).  

3. **Centralized Data Silos**  
   Patient information remains locked away in different systems, limiting researchers and individuals.  

4. **Lack of Preventive Focus**  
   Traditional healthcare often reacts after symptoms appear, rather than preventing issues upstream.  

5. **Privacy & Ownership**  
   Individuals rarely have full control over their data or how it’s utilized.

---

## Vision & Approach

- **Patient Ownership & Empowerment**  
  Give each user **full control** over their medical and lifestyle data, including the ability to grant and revoke **time-bound access**.  

- **Preventive Healthcare**  
  Identify health risks early through AI agents—**Health Risk Prediction**, **Epigenetic Insights**, **Biohacking Recommendations**—to **optimize lifestyle** and **prolong healthspan**.  

- **Privacy by Design**  
  Use secure storage, encryption, or future **blockchain** and **zero-knowledge proofs** to preserve data sovereignty.  

- **Longevity Focus**  
  Combine **real-time monitoring**, **epigenetic modeling**, and personalized interventions to **extend healthspan**, not just lifespan.

---

## Key Features

1. **Gradio UI with Multi-Tab Design**  
   - **Home**: Create or load user profiles.  
   - **Medical Data Vault**: Securely view stored records.  
   - **AI Coach & Professionals**: Get risk assessments, epigenetic estimates, and wellness tips.

2. **AI Agents**  
   - **Health Risk Agent**: Naïve or ML-based risk scoring for chronic illnesses.  
   - **Epigenetic Agent**: Simple algorithm for estimating “biological age.”  
   - **Biohacking Agent**: Personalized recommendations for diet, exercise, and supplements.  
   - **Privacy Agent**: Future integration for **time-bound** or consent-based data access.

3. **Data Vault**  
   - **Vault Manager**: Manages user data in-memory for MVP (plan to upgrade to secure DB/ blockchain).  

4. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** *(Placeholder)*  
   - Demonstrates how external knowledge bases (InterSystems IRIS, vector DBs) could supply domain-specific info to the AI agents.

5. **Modular Architecture**  
   - Easy to scale or swap in real ML models, secure storage, and more advanced RAG pipelines.
